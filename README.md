# Bulls-Cows-R
Bulls &amp; Cows in reverse (Computer is the Player)

`Bulls and Cows` is a game i know as "4 digits" and "mastermind like minigame" inside other games.
But here it goes the other way: the computer guess 4 digits and you give the hints.

**Bulls** are matching digits in their right positions.
 
**Cows** are digits on wrong positions.

## Note: It's Alpha

The Code is in the Dev branch and i don't merge to master until the game is ready to use.

This is my first own non-script based game. The main goal is to learn Rust, expect weird things ;)
